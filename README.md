## Hi there üëã I'm Clara.

I'm am a behavioral ecologist using remote sensing to study marine mammals. These days I use drones to study the behavior and morphology of marine mammals, but my background is in studying marine megafauna using image analysis and drone data (üêã,üêß). I've spent years developing software tools to help with research, mostly in the world of cetacean photogrammetry. 

I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar in Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute where I'm studying social behavior.
