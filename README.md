## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm am a behavioral ecologist using remote sensing to study marine mammals. Specifically, I use drones to study the behavior and morphology of marine mammals and I've spent years developing software tools as part of that process.

I'm currently a postdoctoral scholar in Oregon State University's Marine Mammal Institute where I'm studying social behavior.
